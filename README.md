# Black-Ops-1-Stock-Models
A large collection of stock models missing from the Black Ops Mod Tools. Use on top of an installation from Mythical's [Black Ops Mod Tools Installer](https://github.com/Mythical-Github/Black-Ops-Mod-Tools-Installer) to ensure all models missing from this collection are present.

# Installation
Download the repo's source code, placing the `raw`, `model_export` and `source_data` folders into the main Black Ops 1 directory.
> [!NOTE]
> Only the `xmodel`, `xmodelparts`, and `xmodelsurfs` folders are required for successful installation. All other folders within `raw` contain images and materials that come stock with the mod tools, which are optional to install.
> The `source_data` and `model_export` folders are optional, but are recommended to prevent files from being deleted by the converter.
