# Black-Ops-1-Stock-Models
A collection of stock models missing from the Black Ops Mod Tools. Use on top of an installation from Mythical's [Black Ops Mod Tools Installer](https://github.com/Mythical-Github/Black-Ops-Mod-Tools-Installer) to ensure all models missing from this collection are present.

# Installation
> [!WARNING]
> Avoid running the Converter or the "Convert All" option within Asset Manager if you choose the first installation option, as files you don't have GDTs for will be deleted.

There are two options for downloading the collection:
* I only want to use the assets (~300 MB size):
  1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/arrowsv/Black-Ops-1-Stock-Models/releases) page and download the latest release.
  2. Extract the downloaded zip file into your main Black Ops 1 game directory.

* I want to use the assets and have the source files (~4 GB size):
  1. Above the list of files on the repo's main page, click the `Code` button and click `Download ZIP`.
  2. Extract the downloaded zip file into your main Black Ops 1 game directory, excluding the README.md and LICENSE files.
